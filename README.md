JRuby and JFreeCharts Examples
==============================

This repository contains a number of examples of using JRuby and the JFreeCharts library to generate beautiful charts without any external processes or network traffic. JRuby allows you to call JVM-based libraries from the comfort of Ruby!

Running the Examples
--------------------

These examples should work with any recent version of JRuby, but we recommend installing the latest JRuby 10 release using your favorite Ruby installer or downloading from [jruby.org](https://jruby.org).

1. Install a JDK, if you don't already have one. JRuby 10 requires JDK 21+, JRuby 9.4 will work with JDK 8 (also known as 1.8).
2. Install JRuby. Most Ruby installers know about JRuby, but there's also packages for major operating systems. You can also just download a JRuby tarball, unpack it, and put the `bin` dir in your `PATH`. It's that easy!
3. Run `jruby -S lock_jars` from the root of this repository to fetch and install the JFreeChart library.
4. Run any of the example scripts from the `examples` directory!
